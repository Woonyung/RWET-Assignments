I carefully researched chargers and choose this one knowing that others had reported issues with ports failing. I choose this model for its ability to handle multiple devices but also for the Anker name as I've been pleased in the past with the build quality and performance of other Anker devices.

So after 1.5 months of light use, imagine my disappointment when ports 2 & 4 failed, followed quickly by port 5. In 48 hours, I went from being able to charge 5 items to just 2. I've only used OEM cables and tried each cable in each port. I can verify without a doubt that the issue doesn't stem from the cables nor the devices being charged. An important feature for a charger is its robustness. I expected more from an Anker product as I've been pleased with my other Anker purchases.

Update1:
Anker's customer service contacted me within hours of my posting this review and offered to ship a replacement unit. The unit is on its way to me and I intend to more carefully observe when the ports fail or what conditions lead to those failures. As I had mentioned, I was aware of other reviewers' issues with dead or failing ports, but I had factored that in my choice of charging unit and my choice of vendor.

Update2:
Anker issued a replacement unit to me at no cost and within very reasonable time. While I was disappointed to have the unit partially fail when I counted on it, I am very impressed by Anker's commitment to customer service and as far as I'm concerned will continue to shop for their products.
