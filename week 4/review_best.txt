If you use a rollerball pen (such as a Pilot Precise V5) like myself, then you have surely met with disappointment in using Moleskine or Miquelrius notebooks. Bleeding galore, especially with the Moleskines.

Leuchtturm 1917 notebooks are a hardbound alternative with 80 gsm paper (there are older ones from 2009 out there with 70 gsm... avoid them and make sure you pick up the new version with the ink-proof symbol on the packaging). Despite the thin feel and look of the paper, there is minimal see through with my Pilot and no bleed through to speak of. The pages remain attractive and perfectly ledgible while writing/drawing on both sides of each page.

Yes, there are notebooks out there with higher quality paper than the Leuchtturm... but you will certainly pay for the difference in going with a Rhodia Webnotebook ($25) or a Quo Vadis Habana ($20). Dollar for dollar, Leuchtturm blows Moleskine out of the water at $13 a pop.

Aside from the paper quality, the other extra features really do make a big difference. The first three pages are designated as a useful table of contents for easy reference. Each page is numbered (and tastefully in small print) and there are labels for the cover and spine included. But best of all is that the graph lines & numbers are printed on the paper very lightly... meaning that nothing of the lines will distract while you draw or transfer if you photocopy your work. This aspect gives Leuchtturm's graph paper a distinct advantage over every brand I have seen or used.
