I wanted to love this notebook. It has all the features I wanted in a notebook -- squared paper, numbered pages, multiple contents pages, lie-flat binding, fray-resistant bookmark ribbon, elastic closure, and it comes in a number of fun colors.

However. When I write in it with my favorite roller-ball gel pens, Uniball Signa 207, the ink beads and dries very slowly, thus marking the facing page when I close the book. 

Others have mentioned that the paper resists bleed-through and feathering when working with fountain pens. The trade-off for that seems to be the beading and smearing that I am experiencing. Once I noticed this, I searched the internet to see if others were having the same experience and found this blog that describes a very similar experience. She found that the smearing only happened in dry environments. Since I plan to use my notebook in primarily indoors locations that are air conditioned in the humid weather, this is very disappointing for me.

For now I've taken to leaving the book open to let the ink dry, or using ball-point pen when I don't expect that to be practical. Neither solution is optimal, obviously, so I'm still searching for the perfect notebook.
