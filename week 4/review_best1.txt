If you use a rollerball pen like myself, then you have surely met with disappointment in using Moleskine or Miquelrius notebooks. Bleeding galore, especially with the Moleskines.

Leuchtturm 1917 notebooks are a hardbound alternative with 80 gsm paper. Despite the thin feel and look of the paper, there is minimal see through with my Pilot and no bleed through to speak of. The pages remain attractive and perfectly ledgible while writing/drawing on both sides of each page.

Yes, there are notebooks out there with higher quality paper than the Leuchtturm... but you will certainly pay for the difference in going with a Rhodia Webnotebook or a Quo Vadis Habana. Dollar for dollar, Leuchtturm blows Moleskine out of the water at $13 a pop.

Aside from the paper quality, the other extra features really do make a big difference. The first three pages are designated as a useful table of contents for easy reference. Each page is numbered and there are labels for the cover and spine included. But best of all is that the graph lines & numbers are printed on the paper very lightly... meaning that nothing of the lines will distract while you draw or transfer if you photocopy your work. This aspect gives Leuchtturm's graph paper a distinct advantage over every brand I have seen or used.
